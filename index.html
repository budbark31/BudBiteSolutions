                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Why do I need a website if I have Facebook?</summary>
                        <p>Facebook owns your audience. Algorithm changes can kill your reach overnight, and you're at their mercy for visibility. A website is YOUR digital property, customers find you through Google, not Facebook's algorithm. Plus, 80% of customers search the web before calling. Without a site ranking on Google Maps and local search, you're invisible to people actively looking for your services.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What is "Digital Hardening" and why should I care?</summary>
                        <p>Digital hardening is the process of securing your online presence against cyber threats. It includes SSL encryption (protecting customer data), automated backups (so you never lose your data), vulnerability scanning (finding weak points before hackers do), and firewall implementation (blocking malicious traffic). For trade businesses, downtime is lost revenue. We ensure your site stays up, secure, and compliant so you can focus on your work.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>How long does it take to build a website?</summary>
                        <p>Typically 1-6 weeks depending on complexity and scope. During our Discovery call, we'll map out a realistic timeline. We prioritize quality over speed, a secure and SEO-optimized site that ranks on Google takes proper planning and execution.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Will my site be mobile-friendly?</summary>
                        <p>100%. Every site we build is mobile-first, meaning it's optimized for phones and tablets first, then desktop. Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites in search rankings, so this directly impacts your visibility to customers searching on their phones.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>What happens if my site goes down?</summary>
                        <p>Automated monitoring alerts us immediately. With our automated backup and disaster recovery system, we can restore your site in minutes, not hours. Plus, we implement redundancy and failover systems so downtime is rare in the first place.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details class="faq-item">
                        <summary>Do you use templates?</summary>
                        <p>No. Templates are bloated, slow, and create security vulnerabilities. We hand-code every site using clean architecture. This means faster load times, better SEO performance, fewer security risks, and a site that's uniquely yours, not a cookie-cutter clone.</p>
